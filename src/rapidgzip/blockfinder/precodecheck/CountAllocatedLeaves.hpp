/**
 * @file This method counts the number of allocated leaves for each code length. E.g., a code length equal to the
 *       maximum code length takes up 1 leave, while a code length 1 shorter takes up 2 leaves, and a code length
 *       2 shorter takes up 4 leaves, and so on. Except for the case with exactly 1 code length of 1, the full
 *       tree should be occupied in terms of projected leaves.
 *       This version is so easy and does not require huge lookup tables that it is embarrassing that I did not think
 *       of this approach much sooner. I was too occupied to incrementally improve the histogram based approach.
