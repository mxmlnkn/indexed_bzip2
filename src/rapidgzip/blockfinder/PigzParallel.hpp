 * -> For 12 threads, more than half of the time is spend in refilling the buffer!
 *    I might be able to squeeze out that last bit of performance by overlapping refilling with searching
 *    in a kind of double-buffering. But the critical path would still be the refilling, i.e., the 0.097s, i.e.,
 *    even with this the expected bandwidth would "only" be ~4200 MB/s. This does not even sound like full memcpy
 *    speed (which I would have expected to be ~10 GB/s).
 *    I might have to parallelize the call to std::fread basically :/... ... Normally, that should speed up things
 *    much but on /dev/shm it might work. Plus, it might improve locality because each thread reads their own data
 *    which might move them into L1 cache of that particular core!
 *  -> Maybe that buffer -> subBuffer partitioning approach is just wrong. Just use a SharedFileReader and let
 *     each thread load its own buffer. Of course the shared file reader might serialize the reading anyway...
 *     I would need to clone/reopen the FileReader for each thread if it is supported.
